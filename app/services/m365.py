    Uses the Microsoft Graph Reports API (``getMailboxUsageDetail``) to fetch

    user accounts (from ``get_all_users``) are classified as ``UserMailbox``
    entries; all other active mailboxes in the report are classified as
    ``SharedMailbox`` entries (which typically covers shared mailboxes, room
    mailboxes and equipment mailboxes).

    For each user mailbox, inbox message rules are queried to count forwarding
    rules set up by the owner.  This requires the ``MailboxSettings.Read``
    application permission.  Forwarding rule counts default to 0 for shared
    mailboxes (and for user mailboxes where the rules endpoint is unavailable).

    For each enabled user, their mail-enabled M365 group memberships are fetched
    and stored in ``m365_mailbox_members`` (keyed by the group's primary SMTP
    address).  This builds a reverse index – for each group-backed mailbox, who
    are its members – so that ``get_mailbox_permissions()`` can report who can
    access a given mailbox without a live Graph round-trip.  Run a mailbox sync
    to refresh the data.

    Direct FullAccess mailbox permissions (assigned outside of group membership)
    are fetched via the Exchange Online PowerShell REST API using
    ``Get-MailboxPermission``.  This requires the ``Exchange.ManageAsApp``
    application permission and an appropriate Exchange RBAC role (e.g. Exchange
    Administrator) assigned to the provisioned service principal.  If Exchange
    Online access is unavailable, group-membership-based permissions are still
    synced.

    Requires the ``Reports.Read.All`` and ``MailboxSettings.Read`` application
    permissions granted to the provisioned enterprise app.  Re-provision the
    enterprise app to pick up these permissions if they were added after initial
    provisioning.
