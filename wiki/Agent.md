# MyPortal Agent

The MyPortal agent provides a permission-aware assistant that searches knowledge base articles, tickets requested or watched by the signed-in user, and available hardware or product recommendations. Responses are generated through the Ollama/OpenAI integration module, and the agent never surfaces content outside of the user's entitlements.

## Prerequisites

1. **AI runtime** – Install and expose an Ollama instance, configure OpenAI API access, or run a self-hosted llama.cpp server with its OpenAI-compatible API enabled. The default Ollama configuration expects `https://127.0.0.1:11434`.
2. **Portal configuration** – Ensure the following environment variables are defined (already included in `.env.example`):
   - `OLLAMA_PROVIDER` – `ollama`, `openai`, or `llamacpp`.
   - `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` – HTTP(S) endpoint for Ollama, OpenAI, or an OpenAI-compatible llama.cpp host. Use `https://api.openai.com` for OpenAI.
   - `OLLAMA_MODEL` – Default model name (for example `llama3`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, or your llama.cpp model alias).
   - `OLLAMA_PROMPT` – Optional default prompt used by automation flows.
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` – Bearer token for OpenAI or authenticated OpenAI-compatible gateways. Leave blank for unauthenticated local Ollama/llama.cpp.
3. **Database connectivity** – Run migrations through the existing startup process so the `tickets`, `knowledge_base`, and `shop` tables are available. SQLite fallback is supported when MySQL credentials are not configured.
4. **Webhook monitoring** – The agent records Ollama/OpenAI requests in the webhook monitor (`/admin/webhooks`). Ensure the monitoring tables are migrated and accessible to administrators.

## Enabling the agent

1. Sign in as a super administrator and navigate to **Admin → Modules**.
2. Locate the **Ollama/OpenAI** module, configure the base URL, model, and prompt if required, and set the module to **Enabled**.
3. The change takes effect immediately; no service restart is required. The install (`scripts/install_production.sh`) and upgrade (`scripts/upgrade.sh`) scripts already provision the integration module catalogue during deployment.
4. Verify connectivity from the webhook monitor. Each agent request registers a manual webhook event named `module.ollama.<provider>.generate`. Failed events are retried by the existing monitoring service.

## Using the agent

- The left menu includes **Search**, which opens the AI Search workspace at `/search`. Enter a question such as _"How do I reset the VPN appliance?"_ to search for matching knowledge base articles, your own accessible tickets, and relevant product recommendations.
- Results show a structured answer (rendered in Markdown-style text) followed by cited sources. Source identifiers use `[KB:slug]`, `[Ticket:#id]`, or `[Product:SKU]` markers.
- The agent only operates on data available to the current user:
  - Knowledge base visibility is enforced through the existing permission scopes.
  - Tickets are limited to records requested by or watched by the user and scoped to their accessible companies.
  - Products are retrieved only when the user or their company memberships allow shop access.
- Responses include the Ollama/OpenAI model used, the UTC generation timestamp (rendered in the user's local timezone via the browser), and the webhook event identifier for auditing.

## API endpoint

The agent can be accessed programmatically through the `/api/agent/query` endpoint.

```http
POST /api/agent/query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "Summarise my open firewall tickets"
}
```

Successful responses return:

```json
{
  "query": "Summarise my open firewall tickets",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "answer": "…",
  "model": "llama3",
  "event_id": 4182,

        "title": "Firewall throughput alerts",
        "duplicate_count": 0,

      }
    ],

        "summary": "",
        "excerpt": "",
        "updated_at": "2024-12-11T08:30:00Z",
        "url": "/knowledge-base/articles/network-hardening"
      }
    ],
    "tickets": [
      {
        "id": 512,
        "subject": "Firewall throughput alerts",
        "status": "open",

        "summary": "",

      }
    ],
    "products": []
  },
  "context": {
    "companies": [
      { "company_id": 42, "company_name": "Contoso" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `stages` array exposes query-understanding, retrieval, deduplication, evidence-review, category-summary, and final-answer progress for non-streaming clients. Query understanding, evidence review, category summary, and final answer each run as separate internal LLM requests with a `stage` marker in the module payload for auditing. The `evidence` object contains curated, grouped RAG evidence by source type so duplicate chats are represented as duplicate counts and references instead of repeated snippets.

Streaming clients can call `POST /api/agent/query/stream` with the same request body to receive server-sent events for `stage`, `evidence`, `answer_delta`, and `done` events.

HTTP `401` is returned when the caller is unauthenticated. If the Ollama/OpenAI module is disabled the response status is `skipped` and the payload only contains the contextual sources.

## Security notes

- The agent never forwards raw credentials to the configured inference provider. Only sanitized snippets from authorised portal entities are included in the prompt, and API keys are redacted in webhook monitoring.
- When no accessible context is found the agent instructs Ollama/OpenAI to explain that no answer is available, avoiding hallucinated responses.
- Responses are rendered as escaped HTML in the browser, ensuring that Markdown returned by Ollama/OpenAI cannot inject unsafe tags.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Agent status reads *"The Ollama/OpenAI module is disabled"* | Enable the Ollama/OpenAI module or verify the configuration in **Admin → Modules**. |
| Agent returns *"Unable to contact the agent"* | Check network reachability to the Ollama/OpenAI host and review webhook events for failures. |
| Products do not appear as sources | Confirm the user’s company membership has `can_access_shop`, `can_access_cart`, or `can_access_orders` enabled. |

For persistent issues consult the webhook monitor (`/admin/webhooks`) or the application logs generated by the systemd service created during installation.
