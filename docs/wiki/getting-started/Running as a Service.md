# Running MyPortal as a systemd Service

The instructions below describe how to install MyPortal as a hardened
`systemd` service on a Linux host. The goal is to provide a reproducible
setup that keeps the application running, applies migrations at startup,
and limits exposure in the event of a compromise.

## 1. Create a dedicated service account

Run these commands as `root` (or with `sudo`) to create an unprivileged
user and group. The service user owns the application files and has no
shell access for improved security.

```bash
useradd --system --create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin myportal
mkdir -p /opt/myportal
chown myportal:myportal /opt/myportal
```

Clone the repository or deploy your application artifact into
`/opt/myportal`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update secrets and
connection strings as needed.

## 2. Prepare the virtual environment

Switch to the service account and bootstrap the Python environment. This
keeps dependencies isolated from the system Python install.

```bash
sudo -u myportal -H bash -c '
  cd /opt/myportal && \
  python3 -m venv .venv && \
  source .venv/bin/activate && \
  python scripts/bootstrap_venv.py
'
```

Re-run the bootstrap script whenever you update dependencies. It will
ensure `pip install -e .` runs inside the managed environment.

## 3. Store environment variables securely

Create an environment file that only the service account can read. This
avoids embedding credentials in the unit file.

```bash
cat <<'ENV' | sudo tee /etc/myportal.env
SESSION_SECRET=change-me
TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-me
DATABASE_URL=mysql+aiomysql://user:pass@127.0.0.1:3306/myportal
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
ENV
chmod 600 /etc/myportal.env
chown myportal:myportal /etc/myportal.env
```

Update the values to match your deployment. Keep secrets strong and do
not commit the file to version control.

## 4. Create the systemd unit

Write the following unit file to `/etc/systemd/system/myportal.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=MyPortal customer portal
After=network-online.target mysql.service redis.service
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=notify
User=myportal
Group=myportal
WorkingDirectory=/opt/myportal
EnvironmentFile=/etc/myportal.env
ExecStart=/opt/myportal/scripts/start_with_auto_update.sh /opt/myportal/.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
# Sandbox the process as much as possible without breaking migrations or file access.
NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=true
ReadWritePaths=/opt/myportal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Key points:

- `start_with_auto_update.sh` wraps the Uvicorn process. When startup
  fails, it runs `scripts/upgrade.sh --auto-fallback` to pull the latest
  code (using credentials from `.env` when present) before trying again.
  Configure behaviour via `UVICORN_AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED`,
  `UVICORN_AUTO_UPDATE_ATTEMPTS`, and
  `UVICORN_AUTO_UPDATE_RETRY_DELAY` in the environment file.
- `Type=notify` allows Uvicorn to report readiness to systemd. Remove the
  directive if you are not using Uvicorn's `--factory` or `--lifespan`
  support.
- The service runs as the dedicated `myportal` user with a restricted
  home directory and `NoNewPrivileges` enabled.
- `ProtectSystem` and `ProtectHome` restrict filesystem access while
  keeping `/opt/myportal` writable for logs and migrations.

## 5. Enable and start the service

Reload systemd so it recognises the new unit, then enable and start it.

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now myportal.service
```

Systemd will apply database migrations each time the service starts,
thanks to the startup hook in `app/main.py`.

## 6. Add an nginx frontend on port 80

MyPortal ships with a ready-to-use nginx frontend config that listens on
port 80 and proxies requests to Uvicorn on `127.0.0.1:8000`.

```bash
cp /opt/myportal/deploy/nginx/myportal.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/myportal.conf
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myportal.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myportal.conf
nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
```

`server_name _;` is a catch-all host. Replace it in
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/myportal.conf` with your actual hostname (for
example, `server_name myportal.example.com;`).

## 7. Monitor and maintain the service

Check the service status and logs with:

```bash
systemctl status myportal.service
journalctl -u myportal.service -f
```

If you run updates via `scripts/upgrade.sh` or the scheduler's `system_update`
task, the upgrade helper honours three environment variables defined in
`.env`:

- `APP_UPGRADE_MODE` selects the default deploy path for queued updates:
  `graceful` (default), `rolling`, or `restart`.
- `SYSTEMD_SERVICE_NAME` overrides the default `myportal` unit name.
- `APP_RESTART_COMMAND` executes a custom restart command (for example,
  `sudo systemctl restart myportal.service`) before falling back to the
  standard `systemctl` invocations.

When none of the restart strategies succeed, the helper now exits with a
non-zero status so scheduled updates surface actionable errors instead of
silently continuing without restarting the application.

When deploying updates, pull the latest code, reinstall dependencies if
needed, and prefer the helper so upgrades stay on the zero-downtime path:

```bash
cd /opt/myportal
sudo -u myportal -H git pull origin main
sudo -u myportal -H /opt/myportal/.venv/bin/pip install -e .
sudo -u myportal /opt/myportal/scripts/upgrade.sh --graceful
```

For **zero-downtime upgrades**, `APP_UPGRADE_MODE=graceful` keeps
single-instance installs on `systemctl reload` (which sends `SIGHUP` so
Uvicorn workers cycle without dropping connections), while
`APP_UPGRADE_MODE=rolling` promotes the blue/green topology in
`deploy/systemd/myportal@.service` + `deploy/nginx/myportal-bluegreen.conf`.
Use `APP_UPGRADE_MODE=restart` only when you explicitly want the classic
full-restart path:

```bash
sudo -u myportal /opt/myportal/scripts/upgrade.sh --graceful
```

See [`zero_downtime_upgrades.md`](zero_downtime_upgrades.md) for the
single-server (`--graceful`) and two-instance (`--rolling`) deploy
flows, including the `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints that nginx
uses to gate traffic during a reload.

If the service fails to start, `systemctl status` will show the most
recent errors. Systemd automatically restarts the process after five
seconds; adjust `RestartSec` as needed for your environment.

## 8. Optional hardening

- Place the application behind a reverse proxy (for example nginx) that
  terminates TLS and sets secure headers (see step 6 for the baseline
  frontend config).
- Configure firewall rules so only nginx ports (typically 80/443) are
  internet-facing; keep Uvicorn on localhost-only port 8000.
- Define `FAIL2BAN_LOG_PATH` in `/etc/myportal.env` and install the bundled
  Fail2ban filter/jail to automatically ban brute force login attempts.
- Use `tmpfiles.d` to rotate Loguru output if you configure file-based
  logging.
- Integrate with your monitoring stack to alert on repeated restarts or
  health check failures.

With these steps in place, MyPortal runs as a resilient service that can
be managed with the same tooling as the rest of your infrastructure.
