# MyPortal

> **Note:** MyPortal is ~99% "vibe coded" and built primarily for internal use to suit what I need. You are welcome to use the app and create issues which I will look at when I have time. PRs are not accepted at this time, but that may change in the future. Many features work but have limited testing, and others work but not as well as they should — for example, some API `POST` requests may currently behave as `GET` requests.

MyPortal is a Python-first customer portal built with FastAPI, async MySQL access, and Jinja-powered views. The application provides a modern Python architecture that is easy to extend, test, and deploy.

There are no default login credentials; the first visit will prompt you to register the initial super administrator. If no user records exist the login flow transparently redirects to the registration screen.

## Documentation Structure

- Core project documentation remains in `docs/` for backward-compatible links.
- Migrated wiki content is grouped under `docs/wiki/` with normalized, user-friendly kebab-case file names.
- Start with `docs/wiki/index.md` for the wiki content table of contents.

## Change Log Management

- Each release note lives in the `changes/` directory as a JSON document named with its GUID.
- The FastAPI startup routine imports those files into the `change_log` database table so updates are queryable alongside other audit data.
- Historical entries stored in `changes.md` are automatically migrated on startup, ensuring legacy notes remain available without manual intervention.
- When adding a new feature or fix, create a new GUID-named JSON file in `changes/` with the change metadata; the importer will synchronise it into the database using UTC timestamps.

## Syncro Company Importer

Super administrators can populate and refresh the company directory directly from Syncro via the controls on the Syncro module card (**Admin → Modules → Syncro**). The workflow:

- Retrieves every customer record from Syncro using the configured rate limit.
- Matches existing companies by Syncro customer ID or name and updates their names, addresses, and mappings in place.
- Creates any missing companies and attaches the Syncro identifier so future imports and ticket syncs stay linked.

Progress is surfaced via the JSON response from `POST /admin/syncro/import-companies`, reporting how many companies were fetched, created, updated, or skipped. When using the module card action from the admin UI, success messages are shown inline on the module page. The importer requires the Syncro integration module to be enabled with both a base URL and API key.

## Company ID Lookup

MyPortal can automatically lookup missing external IDs from integrated services when working with companies. This feature helps maintain synchronisation between MyPortal and external systems like Syncro, Tactical RMM, and Xero.

### Automatic Lookup on Create/Update

When creating or updating a company through the API, MyPortal automatically attempts to lookup any missing external IDs:

- **Syncro Company ID** – Searches Syncro customers by company name to find matching customer records
- **Tactical RMM Client ID** – Searches Tactical RMM agents to find matching client records  
- **Xero Contact ID** – Placeholder for future Xero contact lookup implementation

The lookup happens asynchronously after the company is created or updated, ensuring the API remains responsive. Only missing IDs are looked up—if an ID is already set, it is not overwritten.

### Scheduled Task for Bulk Refresh

A scheduled task command `refresh_company_ids` is available to refresh missing IDs across all companies:

- When configured with a `company_id`, it refreshes only that specific company
- When run without a company context, it processes all companies in the system

Companies that already have all external IDs configured are automatically skipped to minimize unnecessary API calls. The task returns detailed metrics about how many companies were processed, updated, skipped, or encountered errors.

To set up the scheduled task:

1. Navigate to **Admin → Scheduled Tasks**
2. Create a new task with command `refresh_company_ids`
3. Optionally specify a `company_id` to limit the scope
4. Configure the cron schedule (e.g., `0 2 * * *` for daily at 2 AM)

### API Integration Notes

- The Syncro lookup searches up to the first 10 pages of customers to avoid excessive API usage
- The Tactical RMM lookup fetches all agents and extracts unique client mappings
- All lookups use case-insensitive name matching for robust identification
- Configuration errors (e.g., missing API credentials) are handled gracefully without blocking other operations

## Syncro Ticket Importer

Super administrators can synchronise Syncro tickets into MyPortal directly from **Admin → Syncro ticket import** once the Syncro integration module is enabled. The import console offers
three modes:

- **Single ticket** – supply a Syncro ticket ID for one-off imports or re-syncs.
- **Range import** – provide `startId` and `endId` values to sweep a consecutive block of tickets.
- **Import all tickets** – iterate through the entire Syncro queue using the 25-item pagination window.

Each request observes the Syncro 180 requests-per-minute ceiling and reports how many tickets were created, updated, or skipped
after upserting into MyPortal.

The same workflow is exposed through the Swagger-documented endpoint `POST /api/tickets/import/syncro`. The request body accepts
camelCase or snake_case keys:

```json
{
  "mode": "range",
  "startId": 1500,
  "endId": 1525
}
```

Use `"mode": "single"` with `ticketId` for targeted imports or `"mode": "all"` without additional fields to crawl every page.
The response echoes the mode alongside `fetched`, `created`, `updated`, and `skipped` counters so integrations can audit the
result.

## Port Catalogue & Pricing Workflows

The portal now exposes a dedicated port catalogue that allows super administrators
to maintain structured metadata (name, country, timezone, region, geographic
coordinates) for each port. Authenticated users can search and filter the
catalogue via the `/ports` API while super administrators can create, update,
and archive entries. Each port supports secure document uploads—files are
sanitised, size-limited to 15&nbsp;MB, stored under `app/static/uploads`, and
served through the `/static/uploads/...` namespace. Metadata about the
uploader, upload time, and file characteristics is recorded alongside the
database entry.

Pricing operations are handled through workflow-oriented endpoints that allow
teams to draft, submit, approve, or reject rate cards for each port. Every
transition captures the actor, timestamps (stored in UTC), currency, and
effective dates so audit requirements are met. Approval and rejection actions
automatically create notifications that appear in the `/notifications` feed,
ensuring requesters are alerted as statuses change. The interactive Swagger UI
lists the full set of CRUD routes and supported query parameters for filtering
and sorting.

## Notifications API

Authenticated users can review their notification feed at `/notifications` or via
`GET /api/notifications`, filtering by event type, read status, search terms,
and time ranges. Super administrators may now create notifications directly via
`POST /api/notifications`, supplying an `event_type`, human readable `message`,
optional `user_id` recipient, and structured metadata payload. When `user_id`
is omitted the notification is treated as a broadcast for every user. Newly
created notifications are surfaced immediately in the UI and through the
Swagger UI to support automated integrations and operational tooling.

Each user can tailor how those events are delivered from `/notifications/settings`
or programmatically through `GET`/`PUT /api/notifications/preferences`. The
preferences API returns the merged catalogue of known event types and delivery
channels (in-app feed, email, SMS) while updates persist the full set of
choices in a single request. Default events now include shipping status updates
(`shop.shipping_status_updated`) so customers can follow fulfilment progress
alongside billing, port, and webhook alerts.

Supporting endpoints expose aggregated counts and merged event type catalogues
for richer clients:

- `GET /api/notifications/summary` – Returns the total notifications and unread
  counts matching the supplied filters alongside the global unread tally.
- `GET /api/notifications/event-types` – Provides the distinct notification
  event types available to the authenticated user by combining defaults,
  preferences, and recorded history.

## System Refresh API

Realtime clients can subscribe to `/ws/refresh` to receive JSON messages when a
super administrator broadcasts a refresh event. Each payload includes a UTC
timestamp and optional metadata so dashboards can invalidate caches or reload
their data sources without polling.

Super administrators trigger the broadcast from `POST /api/system/refresh`. The
endpoint records an audit log entry detailing how many websocket clients were
contacted, ensuring refresh actions remain traceable. Responses include
`attempted`, `delivered`, and `dropped` counts so operational tooling can
surface delivery metrics in admin dashboards.

## ChatGPT MCP Module

The ChatGPT MCP integration exposes a dedicated `/api/mcp/chatgpt` endpoint so
ChatGPT can triage tickets, append replies, and (optionally) update ticket
metadata using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

1. Visit **Admin → Integration modules → ChatGPT MCP** and generate a strong
   shared secret. The secret is stored as a SHA-256 hash and must also be
   configured inside ChatGPT when registering the MCP server.
2. Select which tools ChatGPT may call. Available tools include `listTickets`,
   `getTicket`, `createTicketReply`, and `updateTicket`. Disable ticket updates
   to enforce read-only access.
3. Set a maximum ticket count (default 50) and, if ChatGPT should post
   replies, supply a system user ID to attribute those updates to.
4. From ChatGPT, configure an MCP server pointing at
   `https://<your-domain>/api/mcp/chatgpt` and present the shared secret via a
   `Bearer` token. The server responds to `initialize`, `listTools`, and
   `callTool` JSON-RPC requests.

Refer to `docs/chatgpt-mcp.md` for the complete JSON payload examples,
per-tool argument schemas, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Template Variables for External Apps

MyPortal exposes a curated set of template variables that can be embedded in
form URLs or other external application links. When a page is rendered these
placeholders are substituted with details from the logged-in user and their
currently selected company. Each variable is available in two forms:

- `{{variable}}` – the raw value.
- `{{variable}}UrlEncoded` – the same value pre-encoded with
  `encodeURIComponent` so it can be safely appended to query strings.

| Placeholder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{user.email}}` | Email address for the logged-in user. |
| `{{user.firstName}}` | User's first name. |
| `{{user.lastName}}` | User's last name. |
| `{{user.fullName}}` | Combination of first and last name with whitespace trimmed. |
| `{{company.id}}` | Numeric identifier of the active company. |
| `{{company.name}}` | Name of the active company. |
| `{{company.syncroId}}` | Syncro customer ID when available for the company. |
| `{{portal.baseUrl}}` | Base URL of the MyPortal instance. |
| `{{portal.loginUrl}}` | Direct link to the MyPortal login page. |

For example, a form URL such as
`https://forms.example.com/start?email={{user.emailUrlEncoded}}&company={{company.nameUrlEncoded}}`
will resolve to the current user's email and company at runtime. Missing values
gracefully fall back to an empty string.

## Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is available.
2. Install the native libraries required by WeasyPrint (Debian/Ubuntu example shown):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0
   ```
   Adjust the command for your distribution by following the upstream guidance at
   [WeasyPrint's installation docs](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html#installation).
3. Create a project-local virtual environment so `pip install -e .` does not conflict with externally managed Python installations:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .\.venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```
   The helper script below automates the process and installs dependencies in one step. Pass `--recreate` to rebuild the environment from scratch.
   ```bash
   python scripts/bootstrap_venv.py
   ```
4. If you did not run the bootstrap script, upgrade pip inside the virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e .
   ```
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the MySQL credentials. Define strong values for `SESSION_SECRET` and `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Optional settings such as Redis, SMTP, and Azure Graph credentials mirror the legacy environment variables. Configure `SMS_ENDPOINT` and `SMS_AUTH` when enabling outbound SMS notifications so the portal can relay messages to your gateway securely.
6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
   On startup the application automatically applies any pending SQL migrations and ensures the database exists.
7. Access `https://localhost:8000` for the responsive portal UI. After signing in, visit `https://localhost:8000/docs` for the interactive Swagger UI covering every API endpoint.
8. The first visit will redirect the login flow to the registration page if no users exist, ensuring the first account becomes the super administrator.

## Database migrations

The application stores its SQL migrations under the top-level `migrations/`
directory and automatically applies new files during startup. Every migration
is recorded in the `migrations` table so repeats are skipped on future boots.

### Reprocessing migration steps

In the rare case that a migration needs to be re-applied (for example after a
manual database restore) you can trigger a targeted or full reprocess straight
from the FastAPI project. Activate the virtual environment and run the helper
below, substituting the migration names you want to re-run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python - <<'PY'
import asyncio

from app.core.database import db


async def main() -> None:
    # Re-run a specific migration file.
    await db.reprocess_migrations(["001_initial_schema"])  # omit the .sql suffix
    await db.disconnect()


asyncio.run(main())
PY
```

Pass a list of migration stems (e.g. `001_initial_schema`) or their `.sql`
filenames. When the list is omitted `reprocess_migrations()` replays every file
in order, deleting their entries from the tracking table before executing the
SQL again. The helper acquires the same advisory lock used during startup, so
other workers wait rather than applying migrations concurrently. Adjust the
lock timeout with the `MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT` environment variable if your
production servers need a longer window.

## Fail2ban Support

Set the optional `FAIL2BAN_LOG_PATH` variable in your `.env` file to mirror authentication events to a dedicated log file. When configured, MyPortal records structured messages such as `AUTH LOGIN FAIL email=user@example.com ip=203.0.113.10 reason=invalid_credentials`, which align with the sample filter at `deploy/fail2ban/myportal-auth.conf`. Pair the filter with the example jail configuration in `deploy/fail2ban/myportal-auth.local`, updating the `logpath` to match your environment. After copying both files into `/etc/fail2ban/{filter.d,jail.d}/`, restart the Fail2ban service so repeated login failures from the same IP are automatically banned.

## Authentication API

All authentication routes are documented in the interactive Swagger UI and summarised below:

- `POST /auth/register` – Creates the first super administrator when no users exist and issues a session cookie.
- `POST /auth/login` – Authenticates credentials (and optional TOTP code) to establish a session and CSRF token.
- `POST /auth/logout` – Revokes the active session and clears authentication cookies.
- `GET /auth/session` – Returns the current session metadata and user profile.
- `POST /auth/password/forgot` – Generates a time-bound password reset token and triggers the outbound notification pipeline.
- `POST /auth/password/reset` – Validates the token and updates the user password with bcrypt hashing.
- `POST /auth/password/change` – Allows an authenticated user to rotate their password after validating the current credential.
- `GET /auth/totp` – Lists active TOTP authenticators for the current user.
- `POST /auth/totp/setup` – Generates a pending TOTP secret and provisioning URI for mandatory enrolment.
- `POST /auth/totp/verify` – Confirms the authenticator code and persists it for future logins.
- `DELETE /auth/totp/{id}` – Removes an existing authenticator when another authenticator remains on the account.

## API Key Management

Super administrators can now mint and revoke API credentials directly from the Swagger UI or via the endpoints below. Each key
is generated as a 64-character token, stored using an HMAC-SHA256 digest peppered with the global secret, and summarised with a
preview prefix so the plaintext is never written to the database.【F:app/security/api_keys.py†L1-L38】【F:app/repositories/api_keys.py†L1-L190】

- `GET /api-keys` – Lists active and (optionally) expired keys with usage counts, last-seen timestamps, and per-IP access
  breakdowns. Sorting, free-text search, and inclusion of expired keys are supported via query parameters.【F:app/api/routes/api_keys.py†L24-L62】
- `POST /api-keys` – Creates a new key, returning the plaintext once alongside its metadata; the operation is captured in the
  audit log with the requesting administrator and source IP.【F:app/api/routes/api_keys.py†L64-L92】
- `GET /api-keys/{id}` – Retrieves a single key record with aggregated usage telemetry for investigative workflows.【F:app/api/routes/api_keys.py†L95-L105】
- `DELETE /api-keys/{id}` – Revokes a key, removes its usage counters, and logs the previous metadata for auditing.
  【F:app/api/routes/api_keys.py†L108-L123】【F:app/repositories/api_keys.py†L132-L190】

## Company Context Switching

- `POST /switch-company` – Updates the active company for the authenticated session. The endpoint accepts either
  form-encoded or JSON payloads with a `companyId` field and honours an optional `returnUrl` parameter. Clients may
  also supply these parameters via the query string when making server-side redirects. A valid CSRF token is required
  for authenticated browsers; send it as the `_csrf` form field or `X-CSRF-Token` header.

## Office 365 Sync

To enable Microsoft 365 license synchronization, register an application in
Azure Active Directory and grant it the required Graph permissions.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and open **Azure Active Directory** →
   **App registrations** → **New registration**.
2. Choose a name for the application and select the supported account types
   for your tenant.
3. Under **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and enter
   `https://<your-domain>/m365/callback`.
4. After creation, note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant)
   ID**.
5. Create a client secret in **Certificates & secrets** and record the value; it
   is shown only once.
6. In **API permissions**, add Microsoft Graph **Application permissions**
   `Directory.Read.All` and `User.Read.All`, then grant admin consent.
7. Open the Office 365 admin page in MyPortal and enter the tenant ID, client
   ID and client secret. The credentials can be edited or removed at any time.
8. From the Office 365 page for a company, click **Authorize** to grant the
   application access. The portal requests the `offline_access` scope so that a
   refresh token is stored for background sync jobs.

## File Storage

Static assets located under `app/static` are served directly. Port documents and
other uploads are written to `app/static/uploads`, grouped by port identifier,
with sanitised filenames and a 15&nbsp;MB size cap. The upload API requires an
authenticated session and records metadata about the uploader, original file
name, content type, and size so administrators can audit stored files. Because
files live under the static directory they are subject to existing theme and
branding controls; access controls should still be enforced via the API layer
when linking to documents.

## CSRF Protection

Authenticated POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE routes require a CSRF token. After
login the API sets a `myportal_session_csrf` cookie containing a random token
that must be echoed back via the `X-CSRF-Token` header (or `_csrf` form field)
on mutating requests. The cookie is readable by client-side JavaScript so that
single-page enhancements can propagate the header automatically.

## Deployment

Run the service with Uvicorn or Gunicorn in production. A representative command using Uvicorn is shown below:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

The application emits structured logs via Loguru and applies database migrations on boot, ensuring zero-touch deployments. Supervisor, systemd, Docker, or any process manager can be used based on your infrastructure standards.

For a hardened systemd configuration that runs MyPortal as a managed Linux service, see [docs/systemd-service.md](docs/systemd-service.md). The guide covers creating a dedicated service account, isolating environment variables, configuring auto-restarts, and verifying the unit status.
For an nginx frontend that listens on port 80 and proxies to the app, use
[`deploy/nginx/myportal.conf`](deploy/nginx/myportal.conf).

## Updating from GitHub

Use the Python-focused automation scripts to stay current. The UI/scheduler checks GitHub for new commits on `origin/main` and, when one is available, writes `var/state/system_update.flag`. Schedule `scripts/process_update_flag.sh` from cron (see `deploy/cron/process_update_flag.cron`) to process that flag every minute: it runs `scripts/upgrade.sh` in the configured deployment mode (`APP_UPGRADE_MODE=graceful|rolling|restart`, default `graceful`), waits for `/readyz` in zero-downtime modes, and only falls back to a full restart when explicitly requested or when the update requires it. If you prefer to run the steps manually, execute the following commands:

```bash
git pull origin main
pip install -e .
sudo -u myportal /opt/myportal/scripts/upgrade.sh --graceful
```

## OpnForm Integration

MyPortal expects an OpnForm instance on the same server. nginx can still proxy
`/myforms/` to that service so that super admins can launch the builder directly
from the Forms admin area. See [docs/opnform.md](docs/opnform.md) for deployment
and security guidance, including the supplied nginx configuration snippet in
[`deploy/nginx/opnform.conf`](deploy/nginx/opnform.conf).

When registering a form inside MyPortal, paste the published OpnForm form URL
into the Forms admin. The server validates that the URL targets the expected
OpnForm host (when configured) and stores it. Forms assigned to users now load
directly in an iframe without being proxied through MyPortal, and template
variables remain available so query string parameters can be personalised for
the current user and company.
