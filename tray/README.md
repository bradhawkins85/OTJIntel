## Build

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- For native UI builds: CGO toolchain for the target platform
- For MSI packaging: .NET SDK 8+ and WiX v7 (`dotnet tool install --global wix --version "7.*"`).
  WiX v7 requires accepting the FireGiant OSMF EULA — the Makefile passes
  `-acceptEula wix7` per https://docs.firegiant.com/wix/osmf/.
- For macOS chat-shell icon and installer packaging: Xcode command-line tools with `iconutil`, `pkgbuild`, `productbuild`, and `hdiutil` (macOS only)
- For chat shell: **Node.js 20+** and npm (required only on the native host runner for each platform)

### Cross-compile (CGO=0, no webview — for RMM deployment)

```sh
cd tray
make build-all         # Windows amd64 + macOS amd64 + macOS arm64
make build-windows
make build-darwin-amd64
make build-darwin-arm64
```

Binaries land in `dist/<platform>/`.

### Build the macOS app icon

The macOS chat-shell app icon is generated during the build from a text-only
recipe so binary icon assets are not committed to the repository. Run this on
macOS with Xcode Command Line Tools installed:

```sh
cd tray
make build-macos-icons
# or, from tray/chat-shell:
npm run build:icons:mac
```

The target creates `tray/chat-shell/build/icon.icns`, which electron-builder
uses for the packaged `myportal-tray-chat.app`. The generated `.icns` and
`.iconset` intermediates are build outputs and should not be committed.

### Build the dedicated chat shell

The chat shell is a minimal Electron app that opens the MyPortal support chat
in an isolated window completely separate from the user's browser sessions.
It **must be built on the target platform** (electron-builder constraint). The macOS build runs the icon generation script before invoking electron-builder.

```sh
# On a Windows host — produces dist/windows/chat-shell/ with the
# myportal-tray-chat.exe executable and persistent Electron runtime files
make build-chat-shell-win

# On a macOS host — produces dist/darwin/myportal-tray-chat.app
make build-chat-shell-mac
```

In CI these targets run as separate jobs on `windows-latest` and `macos-latest`
runners respectively. The resulting artifacts are downloaded into `dist/` before
the MSI / .pkg installer jobs run.

The Windows MSI workflow imports the same password-protected self-signed
code-signing certificate on every build. It signs and verifies the Go agents,
the executables in the Electron chat-shell runtime, and the final MSI with
SHA-256 before uploading the installer. Keeping one PFX means every release has
the same publisher identity and certificate thumbprint until the certificate is
deliberately rotated.

#### Set up the Windows signing certificate

Run the setup script once on a trusted Windows workstation with PowerShell 5.1
or later. Do not run it for each release:

```powershell
cd tray
.\scripts\New-WindowsSigningCertificate.ps1 -OutputDirectory .\signing
```

The script prompts for a PFX password and creates three files:

- `myportal-tray-signing.pfx` — private certificate; store this securely.
- `myportal-tray-signing.pfx.base64` — value for the GitHub Actions secret.
- `myportal-tray-signing.cer` — public certificate for endpoint trust policy.

In the GitHub repository, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
and create these repository secrets:

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PFX` | Entire contents of `myportal-tray-signing.pfx.base64` |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password entered when generating the PFX |

Delete the local base64 file after configuring GitHub. Retain an access-controlled
backup of the PFX and its password; losing either requires certificate rotation.
Deploy `myportal-tray-signing.cer` to **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
and **Trusted Publishers** on managed endpoints before installing the signed
agent. A self-signed certificate is not trusted automatically.

To rotate an expiring or compromised certificate, run the script again, replace
both GitHub secrets together, deploy the new `.cer` to endpoints, and retain the
old public certificate while older signed releases remain in use. Never commit
the PFX, password, base64 file, or generated certificate to this repository.

### Build installer packages

```sh
# Windows MSI (requires WiX v7 on a Windows host — WiX does not support
# building on Linux/macOS, see wixtoolset/issues#7154). The Makefile
# automatically passes `-acceptEula wix7` to satisfy the FireGiant OSMF
# EULA (https://docs.firegiant.com/wix/osmf/).
# Requires dist/windows/chat-shell/ from build-chat-shell-win.
make build-msi          # produces dist/windows/myportal-tray.msi

# macOS .pkg (requires pkgbuild/productbuild — macOS only)
# Requires dist/darwin/myportal-tray-chat.app from build-chat-shell-mac.
make build-pkg          # produces dist/darwin/myportal-tray.pkg

# macOS .dmg wrapping the .pkg (requires hdiutil — macOS only)
make build-dmg          # produces dist/darwin/myportal-tray.dmg

# Build all binaries + MSI (+ .pkg and .dmg on macOS)
make package-all
```

The built installers must be copied to `app/static/tray/` on the MyPortal server so
they are served at `/static/tray/myportal-tray.msi`, `/static/tray/myportal-tray.pkg`, and `/static/tray/myportal-tray.dmg`.
The `scripts/upgrade.sh` handles this automatically: Windows hosts can build the MSI when WiX is installed, and macOS hosts can build the PKG/DMG when Xcode command-line tools are installed. On Linux hosts, build the installers separately on their native platforms and copy them into `app/static/tray/`.

### With native webview (requires CGO)

Remove the `nowebview` build tag and provide the appropriate CGO cross-compiler.  
See `Makefile` comments for details.

## Tests

```sh
cd tray
go test -tags nowebview -count=1 ./...
```

## Chat client architecture

When a user clicks **Support Chat** in the tray menu, `openChatWindow` uses a
three-tier launch strategy:

| Tier | Method | Isolation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Dedicated chat shell** (`myportal-tray-chat`) | Full — Electron `persist:myportal-tray-chat` session partition, completely separate from all browsers; Windows installs use an unpacked Electron runtime so DLL/EXE payloads persist under `%ProgramFiles%\MyPortalTray\chat-shell` instead of extracting to `%TEMP%` on each launch |
| 2 | Chromium-based browser in `--app=` mode with `--user-data-dir` isolation | Partial — separate profile but same browser binary |
| 3 | Default system browser | None — shares user's browser session |

The server-side `chat_client_mode` config field (set per device in the admin UI)
controls this behaviour:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `""` / `"app"` (default) | Try tier 1 → 2 → 3 in order |
| `"browser"` | Skip directly to tier 3 (rollout safety valve) |
| `"shell"` | Require tier 1; warn and abort if the shell is absent (no silent fallback) |

The chat shell binary is installed to:
- **Windows**: `%ProgramFiles%\MyPortalTray\chat-shell\myportal-tray-chat.exe` (current unpacked Electron install) or `%ProgramFiles%\MyPortalTray\myportal-tray-chat.exe` (legacy single-file install fallback)
- **macOS**: `/Library/MyPortal/Tray/myportal-tray-chat.app/Contents/MacOS/myportal-tray-chat`

## Configuration

### Network scanning

When network scanning is enabled by the portal, the Windows service uses the
Windows PowerShell and .NET networking APIs already included with Windows. On
Windows Server 2012 R2 and older systems, it uses WMI and `arp.exe` compatibility
fallbacks instead of the newer NetTCPIP module. It
discovers hosts with ICMP, the neighbor table, reverse DNS, and a bounded scan
of common TCP ports. Each connected network is limited to its local `/24`, so
the tray no longer installs or requires Nmap on Windows. macOS and Linux builds
continue to use Nmap.

### Windows

Registry key: `HKLM\Software\MyPortal\Tray`

| Value        | Type   | Description                              |
|--------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| `PortalURL`  | REG_SZ | Full URL of the MyPortal server          |
| `EnrolToken` | REG_SZ | Per-company install token from admin UI  |
| `AutoUpdate` | REG_SZ | `true` / `false` (default `true`)        |

### macOS

File: `/Library/Preferences/io.myportal.tray.env`

```
MYPORTAL_URL=https://portal.example.com
ENROL_TOKEN=<token>
AUTO_UPDATE=true
```

## Architecture

See [docs/tray_app.md](../docs/tray_app.md) for the full architecture document.

## Deployment

### Windows (PowerShell, RMM one-liner)

```powershell
.\installer\windows\install.ps1 -PortalURL 'https://portal.example.com' -EnrolToken 'TOKEN'
```

To exclude the installed Tray binaries and runtime data from Microsoft Defender,
run the RMM exclusion script as LocalSystem or an administrator. The script is
idempotent and defaults to `%ProgramFiles%\MyPortalTray` and
`%ProgramData%\MyPortal\tray`:

```powershell
.\integrations\tacticalrmm\set-tray-defender-exclusions.ps1
```

Custom paths can be supplied when an installation uses non-standard locations:

```powershell
.\integrations\tacticalrmm\set-tray-defender-exclusions.ps1 `
    -ExclusionPath 'C:\Apps\MyPortalTray', 'D:\MyPortalData'
```

### macOS (bash, RMM one-liner)

```bash
MYPORTAL_URL='https://portal.example.com' ENROL_TOKEN='TOKEN' bash installer/macos/install.sh
```

### macOS — Tactical RMM

Use `integrations/tacticalrmm/install-tray-macos.sh` instead of the generic
one-liner above. Add it to TRMM as a **bash** script (run as **root**) and
configure the required variables as protected Script Variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MYPORTAL_URL` | ✅ | Full URL of the MyPortal server |
| `ENROL_TOKEN` | ✅ | Per-company install token |
| `AUTO_UPDATE` | — | `true` (default) or `false` |
| `PORTAL_API_KEY` | — | MyPortal API key — enables immediate TRMM sync |
| `TRMM_AGENT_ID` | — | Set to `{{agent.agent_id}}` (required with `PORTAL_API_KEY`) |

When `PORTAL_API_KEY` and `TRMM_AGENT_ID` are provided the script also waits
for initial enrolment and calls `/api/tray/trmm-sync` to link the device
immediately. See `docs/wiki/integrations/Tactical RMM Tray Agent Sync.md` for
the full setup guide.


### macOS uninstaller

The macOS package bundles an uninstaller at `/Library/MyPortal/Tray/uninstall.sh`:

```bash
sudo /Library/MyPortal/Tray/uninstall.sh
# Remove config, enrolment state, and logs as well:
sudo /Library/MyPortal/Tray/uninstall.sh --purge
```

The default uninstall stops launchd jobs and removes installed binaries/plists while preserving configuration, state, and logs for troubleshooting or reinstall.

## Security model

- The install token is **single-company** and **rotatable** from the admin UI.
- The device exchanges the install token for a **long-lived per-device auth token** stored in the platform credential store (DPAPI / Keychain System). The install token is then discarded.
- Env-var values are read client-side and only reported when the server explicitly lists them in the allowlist. The server never requests them wholesale.
- The WebSocket endpoint authenticates via the per-device bearer token; revoked devices are rejected immediately.
- The chat shell runs in an isolated Electron session partition (`persist:myportal-tray-chat`) and only loads URLs from the configured portal origin; external links are delegated to the system browser.
